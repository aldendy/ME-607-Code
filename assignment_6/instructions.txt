Assignment 6

Expanding on the looping structure you implemented and tested in Assignment 5, create an internal force routine which returns F^int wavy underscore. This should require you to exercise most of the functionality you-ve implemented up to this point.

Test your internal force calculations on a one-element mesh with a linear displacement profile.
